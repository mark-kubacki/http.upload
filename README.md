Upload for HTTP servers
=======================

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/blitznote.com/src/http.upload/v5)](https://pkg.go.dev/blitznote.com/src/http.upload/v5)

Enables you to upload files, such as build artifacts, to your HTTP server instance.

Licensed under a [BSD-style license](LICENSE).

Highlights
----------

 * uses HTTP PUT and POST for uploads
 * supports HTTP MOVE and DELETE
 * imposes limits on filenames:
   * rejects those that are not conforming to Unicode NFC or NFD
   * rejects any comprised of unexpected alphabets ϟ(ツ)╯
 * limits to file- and transaction sizes independent from any *transport encoding*

Versions
--------

Version | Change
------- | ------
/v4     | Call to `http.Handler` is henceforth the preferred way to use this.
/v5     | No longer limited to local filesystems as backend, the syntax for `to` (`WriteToPath`) has changed.

Warnings
--------

This plugin reveals some errors thrown by your filesystem implementation to the uploader,
for example about insufficient space on the target device..

The way Golang currently decodes *MIME Multipart* (which is used with POST requests) results
in any files you are uploading being held in memory for the duration of the upload.

Configuration Syntax
--------------------

Let this be a legible shorthand for instances of `Handler`:

```
upload <path> {
	to                    "<directory>"

	enable_webdav
	filenames_form        <none|NFC|NFD>
	filenames_in          <u0000-uff00> [<u0000-uff00>| …]
	random_suffix_len     0..N
	promise_download_from <path>

	max_filesize          0..N
	max_transaction_size  0..N
}
```

These settings are required:

 * **path** is the *Scope* you cofigured the handler for, such as Go's `ServeMux`.
   It will be stripped and won't be part of any resulting file and directories.
 * **to** is an existing target directory. Must be a quoted absolute path.
   When using Linux it is recommended to place this on a filesystem which supports
   **O_TMPFILE**, such as (but not limited to) *ext4* or *XFS*.

These are optional:

 * **enable_webdav**: Enables other methods than POST and PUT,
   especially MOVE and DELETE. Is a flag and has no parameters.  
   (`disable_webdav` will no longer be recognized because it's the new default.)
 * **filenames_form**: if given, filenames and directories that are not 
   conforming to Unicode NFC or NFD will be rejected.  
   Set this to one of either values when you get errors indicating that your filesystem
   does not convert names properly. (If in doubt, go with NFC; on Mac PCs with NFD.)  
   The default is to not enforce anything.
 * **filenames_in** allows you to limit filenames to specified Unicode ranges.
   The ranges' bounds must be given in hexadecimal, and start with letter ```u```.  
   Use this setting to prevent users from uploading files in, for example, Cyrillic
   when expect Latin and/or Chinese alphabets only.
 * **random_suffix_len**, if > 0, will result in all filenames getting a randomized suffix.  
   The suffix will start in a `_` (underscore letter) and placed before any extension.  
   For example, `image.png` will be written as `image_a107xm.png` with configuration value *6*.
   Utilize `promise_download_from` to get the resulting filename.  
   The default is 0 for *off*.
 * **promise_download_from** is a string that represents an *URI reference*, such as a path.  
   It will be used to indicate where the uploaded file can be downloaded,
   by responding with HTTP header `Location` (multiple times if need be) for all received files.  
   You will most probably want to set this to the *upload `path`*.  
   The default value is "", which means no HTTP header `Location` will be sent.

 * By **max_filesize** you can limit the size of individual files.
   Unless set to `0`, which means "unlimited" and is the default value, it's in *bytes*.
 * **max_transaction_size** is similar, but applies to uploads of one or more file in one request.
   For example, when using *MIME Multipart* uploads.  
   The behaviour with `max_filesize > max_transaction_size` is currently undefined;
   set *max_transaction_size* to a multiple of *max_filesize*.

Some transfer encodings, such as **base64**, know comments. Those, or super-long headers and the such,
can be exploited to transfer many more bytes than for example *max_transaction_size* would otherwise allow.
Mitigate this by utilizing a different plugin, **http.limits**, which counts incoming bytes
ignorant of any encoding. Set a limit of about 1.4× to 2.05× the *max_transaction_size*.  
This plugin writes files blockwise for a better performance. Limits are rounded up by a few kilobytes to
the next full block.

Tutorial
--------

Setup a minimal configuration like this, or `go run example.go &` after copying it into a separate
directory and removing the line with `+build ignore` (mind the port number, which is `9000` there):

```
upload /web/path {
 	to "/var/tmp"
 	enable_webdav
}
```

… and upload one file:

```bash
# HTTP PUT
curl \
  -T /etc/os-release \
  https://127.0.0.1/web/path/from-release
```

… or more files in one go (sub-directories will be created as needed):

```bash
# HTTP POST
curl \
  -F gitconfig=@.gitconfig \
  -F id_ed25519.pub=@.ssh/id_ed25519.pub \
  https://127.0.0.1/web/path/
```

… which you then can move and delete like this:

```bash
# MOVE is 'mv'
curl -X MOVE \
  -H "Destination: /web/path/to-release" \
  https://127.0.0.1/web/path/from-release

# DELETE is 'rm -r'
curl -X DELETE \
  https://127.0.0.1/web/path/to-release
```

Configuration Examples
----------------------

A host used by someone in Central and West Europe would be configured like this
to accept filenames in Latin with some Greek runes and a few mathematical symbols:

```
upload /college/curriculum {
	to "/home/ellen_baker/inbox"
	filenames_form NFC
	filenames_in u0000–u007F u0100–u017F u0391–u03C9 u2018–u203D u2152–u217F
}
```

A host for Linux distribution packages can be more restrictive:

```
upload /binhost/gentoo {
	to "/var/portage/packages"
	filenames_in u0000–u007F
}
tls {
	…
	clientcas /etc/ssl/dist-uploaders-CA.crt
}
```

… while someone in East Asia would share space on his blog like this:

```
upload /wp-uploads {
	to "/var/www/senpai/wp-uploads"
	enable_webdav
	max_filesize 16777216
	filenames_in u0000–u007F u0100–u017F u0391–u03C9 u2018–u203D u3000–u303f u3040–u309f u30a0–u30ff u4e00–9faf uff00–uffef
}
```
